How to run program


1) Open command prompt
2) paste the following command and press enter:  cd C:\Users\w1515247\golang\src\women-in-media-article-entity-analysis\cmd\cli
3) make sure that the query in main.go returns the articles that you want to analyse
4) Click "File -> Save all" in Atom
4) paste the following command and press enter:  go build && cli.exe


This will analyse all articles that match the query.

To see the results (for now), these commands will be useful


/* see all the entities */
select * from public.article_entities
where <inset conditions>

/* see all the entities with their gender */
SELECT *, n.gender
from public.article_entities a
join public.names n
on a.text = n.name
where  <inset conditions>

/* see the gender count */
select n.gender, count(*)
from public.article_entities a
join public.names n
on a.text = n.name
where  <inset conditions>
group by 1

/* see the entities without a gender */
select * from
public.article_entities a
join public.names n
on a.text = n.name
where  <inset conditions>
and n.gender = ''
