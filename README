How to run program


1) Open command prompt
2) paste the following command and press enter:  cd C:\Users\w1515247\golang\src\women-in-media-article-entity-analysis\cmd\cli
2.5) paste the following command and press enter:  cd C:\Users\w1515247\golang\src\women-in-media-article-entity-analysis\cmd\git pull to check for updates
2.6) If you get a message along the lines of "Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge. Aborting", as long as you haven't made any code changes, you should be safe to run
"git stash" (which will wipe your changes) followed by git pull. WARNING: this will delete any files containing analysis that have ended up in the directory, so make sure you have copied this
somewhere else if you want to keep it going forwards.
3) make sure that the query in main.go returns the articles that you want to analyse
4) Click "File -> Save all" in Atom
4) paste the following command and press enter:  go build && cli.exe


This will analyse all articles that match the query.

To see the results (for now), these commands will be useful


/* see all the entities */
select * from public.article_entities
where <inset conditions>

/* see all the entities with their gender */
SELECT *, n.gender
from public.article_entities a
join public.names n
on a.text = n.name
where  <inset conditions>

/* see the gender count */
select n.gender, count(*)
from public.article_entities a
join public.names n
on a.text = n.name
where  <inset conditions>
group by 1

/* see the entities without a gender */
select * from
public.article_entities a
join public.names n
on a.text = n.name
where  <inset conditions>
and n.gender = ''
